In my MIT AI Strategy program, one discussion hit me hard: how simple the path to real competitive advantage can be if you apply AI with intention.

Every company is chasing AI right now, but few can answer: “What kind of advantage are we actually pursuing?”

MIT framed it in 3 timeless choices:
* Cost Leadership: Use AI to automate repetitive work and cut review cycles.
* Differentiation: Use AI to create higher-quality content, faster insights, or new experiences.
* Focus: Use AI to deeply serve one niche better than anyone else.

Here’s the challenge: If AI isn’t clearly driving one of these, it’s not strategy, it’s noise.

Which of the three do you think your organization is truly pursuing?

Happy to compare notes. I’ve been helping pharma leaders map their next advantage in short, 30-minute working sessions.
